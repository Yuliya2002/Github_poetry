<h1>Why we should go for a walk?</h1>
<p>Walking makes you happier. Moving around outdoors can lift one's mood quickly. Walking reduces stress. 
In response, I'd remind them that I was only committing to one walk per week.<p>

<p>Why should you start walking? 
 Walking for 30 to 60 minutes each day is one of the best things you can do for your body, mind, and spirit.<p>

<p> 10-minute walk becomes a habit, set a new goal, such as, "I'll walk for 20 minutes after work.
You should keep the six-foot rule, even if they are people you used to</p>
